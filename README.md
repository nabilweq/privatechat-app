# Chateyyu Private chat application

Here is the deployed link [Chateyyu](https://chateyyu.netlify.app/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I had used latest React libraries like - Hooks for frontend, and for backend i had used firebase for authentication, and for data storing i used firebase firestore.
At the end the backend is completely depended on firebase.

The project is deployed on Netlify. it is a free service to host fronted code.
